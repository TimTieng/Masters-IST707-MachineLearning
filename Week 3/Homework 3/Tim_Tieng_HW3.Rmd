## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
# Load required packages.
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Load in data and inspect
bankData <- read.csv("/Users/timtieng/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Desktop/Masters in Applied Data Science/IST-707 Machine Learning/Week 3/Homework 3/bankdata_csv_all.csv")

# Inspect the attribute names and datatypes
str(bankData)

# Observations - there is 600 rows with 12 variables
```
```{r}
# Verify if Data set has missing values

colSums(is.na(bankData))

# Observations - There are no missing values for each of the attributes
```

```{r}
# Summary Statistics of numeric attributes

# Visualize value frequencies - Visualizations should confirm summary statistics for each of the three numeric columns
